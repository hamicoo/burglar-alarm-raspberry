in this simple project, I've developed a motion detector with a raspberry pi and a USB camera.
first of all, you need to change the input pin according to yours.
and also you need to paste your own Telegram token.
you can also use the Telegram library but I've used Telegram Rest API.

you can also comment Led function it just for blinking LED when any movement happens.
