in this simple project, I've developed a motion detector with a raspberry pi and a USB camera.
first of all, you need to change the input pin according to yours.
and also you need to paste your own Telegram token.

you can also remove Led function line it just for blinking LED when any movement happens if you have RGB led in your board you can use it.
